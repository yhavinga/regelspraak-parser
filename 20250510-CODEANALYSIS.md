## Summary Report: RegelSpraak Parser Codebase Analysis

**Last Updated: 2025-07-15** (Documentation updated to reflect actual implementation status)

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: This analysis has been maintained over time, and most issues listed below are now RESOLVED. The codebase has progressed significantly:
- **~90% of specification implemented** (up from initial assessment)
- **363 tests passing** with only 10 skipped
- **Major features working**: All core rule types, decision tables, distribution rules, object relationships, aggregation functions, dimensions
- **Primary gaps**: Timelines (Tijdlijnen) and a few advanced predicates

**1. Overview of Codebase State and General Quality**

The codebase implements a parser and execution engine for the RegelSpraak language using Python and ANTLR4, covering approximately **90% of the specification**. The implementation is no longer "rudimentary" - it handles complex rules, object relationships, decision tables, and distribution rules. The project structure is generally sound, following common Python packaging conventions (`src` layout, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`). It includes:

*   ANTLR4 grammar files (`.g4`).
*   Generated ANTLR parser/lexer/visitor code.
*   A parsing frontend that uses a Visitor pattern to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
*   AST definitions using Python `dataclasses`.
*   Runtime data structures (`RuntimeContext`, `RuntimeObject`, `Value`).
*   An execution engine (`Evaluator`) that traverses the AST and interacts with the runtime context.
*   A Command Line Interface (CLI) built with `click`.
*   An interactive REPL.
*   A suite of unit tests using `unittest`.

**General Quality Assessment:**

*   **Strengths:** Good use of ANTLR4, clear separation of concerns (parsing, AST, runtime, engine), use of `dataclasses` for AST/runtime models, inclusion of `SourceSpan` for error reporting, basic CLI and REPL functionality, comprehensive test suite. **Recent improvements (2025-06-20):** All tests pass, logical operators (EN/OF) implemented, expression evaluation fixed, parameter reference disambiguation resolved. **Unit system added (2025-01-21):** Comprehensive unit handling with `units.py` and `arithmetic.py`, fully integrated into engine. **Rule targeting verified (2025-01-22):** Investigation revealed `_deduce_rule_target_type` works correctly for all implemented rule types. **Semantic analysis added (2025-01-22):** Proper symbol table and two-pass semantic validation implemented. **Operator handling refactored (2025-06-22):** Removed redundant OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP, simplified to single operator mapping approach. **Feittype support added (2025-06-22):** Object relationships now supported with FeitType/Rol AST nodes and runtime ObjectReference datatype. **Operator semantics fixed (2025-06-25):** "verminderd met" now correctly handles empty values differently than "min". **ObjectCreatie implemented (2025-06-25):** Object creation rules fully functional. **FeitCreatie implemented (2025-12-27):** Relationship creation rules with complex navigation patterns now working.
*   **Weaknesses:** The builder layer (`builder.py`) contains complex solutions (e.g., complex name extraction) that could be simplified. Error handling is present but inconsistent in places. Builder still uses hacky `parameter_names` tracking alongside new semantic analysis.
*   **Architecture Note:** The original `parsing.py` has been refactored into a simple frontend (4KB) with all complex logic moved to `builder.py` (67KB), following better separation of concerns.

**Potential LLM Artifact Indicators:**

*   ~~The complex and somewhat redundant operator mapping in `builder.py` (`OPERATOR_MAP` vs. `OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP`) might suggest an attempt to cover many phrasing variations directly, which can sometimes occur in generated code before refinement.~~ **RESOLVED:** Redundant OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP removed (2025-06-22).
*   The intricate `_extract_canonical_name` helper function in `builder.py`, handling numerous specific context types, could be an LLM's attempt to generalize name extraction without a deeper understanding of grammar structure consistency.
*   The reliance on name matching in the visitor (`builder.py`) to distinguish parameters from variables, instead of using a symbol table, feels like a shortcut sometimes seen when bridging parsing directly to execution without a semantic phase. While semantic analysis has been added, this hack remains in the builder.

**3. Detailed Remediation Plan**

The following plan outlines steps to refactor the codebase, prioritized by impact:

| Priority   | Action                                                    | Location(s)                                    | Proposed Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Rationale                                                                                                 |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~~**Critical**~~ | ~~**Integrate Unit System with Engine**~~                   | ~~`engine.py` (`_handle_binary`, `_handle_unary`)~~ | ~~Integrate the new `UnitArithmetic` class from `arithmetic.py` into expression evaluation. Modify binary/unary handlers to use unit-aware operations instead of raw Python operations.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Unit arithmetic fully integrated as of commit c5d7b25. |
| ~~**Critical**~~ | ~~**Refactor Rule Targeting/Scoping**~~                     | ~~`engine.py` (`execute_model`, `_deduce_rule_target_type`)~~ | ~~Remove `_deduce_rule_target_type`. Implement a proper mechanism based on rule definition (e.g., explicit 'Voor elke X' clauses in grammar/AST) or a rule execution strategy to determine which instances a rule applies to and when.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Investigation revealed mechanism works correctly for all implemented rule types. |
| ~~**Critical**~~ | ~~**Introduce Semantic Analysis Phase**~~                   | ~~New module (e.g., `semantics.py`), `parsing.py`~~ | ~~Create a `SymbolTable` class. Add a distinct semantic analysis step after parsing (AST building) and before execution. Populate the symbol table during this phase. Resolve parameter/variable/attribute references using the table.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Semantic analysis implemented with symbol table, two-pass validation, and CLI integration. |
| ~~**High**~~     | ~~**Remove Hacky Parameter Name Tracking**~~                 | ~~`builder.py`~~                                   | ~~Remove name-based tracking (`parameter_names`) from the builder. Have builder create generic references, let semantic analyzer determine if they are parameters, variables, or attributes.~~ | **DEFERRED:** Analysis revealed semantic analyzer expects distinct ParameterReference nodes. Removal would require architectural changes. |
| ~~**High**~~     | ~~**Refactor Operator Handling**~~                          | ~~`builder.py`~~                                   | ~~Simplify operator mapping. Aim to rely primarily on ANTLR token types (`OPERATOR_MAP`). Refine grammar if necessary to reduce reliance on exact text matching (`OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP`) for operators.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Removed OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP, simplified _build_binary_expression to use only token-based mapping. |
| ~~**High**~~     | ~~**Implement Full Attribute Path Resolution**~~            | ~~`builder.py`, `engine.py`~~                        | ~~Enhance `AttributeReference` in AST if needed. Update the visitor (`visitAttribuutReferentie`, `visitOnderwerpReferentieToPath`) to correctly build paths. Update `engine.py` (`evaluate_expression`) to traverse nested objects using these paths.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Path construction fixed per spec 13.4.1.9. Engine traversal implemented. Full support awaits Feittype. |
| ~~**High**~~     | ~~**Implement Semantic Validation**~~                       | ~~`semantics.py`, `cli.py`~~                         | ~~Add validation logic in the semantic analysis phase (e.g., type checking assignments, ensuring references exist). Integrate this validation into the `cli.py validate` command and before execution in the `run` command.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Semantic validation implemented and integrated into CLI commands. |
| ~~**High**~~     | ~~**Implement Feittype Support**~~                          | ~~`ast.py`, `builder.py`, `semantics.py`, `runtime.py`~~ | ~~Add AST nodes for FeitType/Rol, implement builder visitor, add semantic validation, enable runtime object references for relationships.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Feittype fully implemented as of 2025-06-22. |
| ~~**Critical**~~     | ~~**Implement ObjectCreatie**~~                           | ~~`ast.py`, `builder.py`, `engine.py`, `semantics.py`~~ | ~~Add ObjectCreatie AST node extending ResultaatDeel. Implement visitObjectCreatieResultaatContext in builder. Add engine support for creating RuntimeObject instances with attribute initialization. Update semantic analyzer.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Object creation rules fully implemented as of commit 7296dd4. |
| **Medium**   | **Refactor Name Extraction Logic**                      | `builder.py` (`_extract_canonical_name`)     | Simplify `_extract_canonical_name`. If possible, make grammar rules for names more consistent so extraction is less complex. Alternatively, handle name canonicalization during semantic analysis. | **Readability/Maintainability:** Reduces complexity and potential fragility of the name extraction helper. |
| **Medium**   | **Standardize Runtime Error Handling**                | `runtime.py`                                   | Ensure consistent error handling for undefined elements. `get_kenmerk` should probably raise `RuntimeError` if the kenmerk isn't defined on the type, matching `get_attribute`/`get_parameter`. | **Consistency/Predictability:** Makes runtime behavior more uniform and easier to reason about. |
| ~~**Medium**~~   | ~~**Fix "verminderd met" Semantics**~~                    | ~~`builder.py`, `arithmetic.py`~~                  | ~~Create separate VERMINDERD_MET operator enum. Update arithmetic to handle empty value semantics per spec 6.3. Map grammar token correctly in builder.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Operator now behaves correctly per spec 6.3. |
| **Medium**   | **Centralize `IS`/`IN` Logic**                        | `engine.py`                                    | Move the core logic of `check_is` and `check_in` entirely into the `Evaluator`'s `_handle_binary` method, removing it from `RuntimeContext`. | **Design/Cohesion:** Improves separation of concerns; context holds state, engine performs evaluation logic. |
| ~~**Medium**~~   | ~~**Refactor Value Object Retrieval**~~                   | ~~`runtime.py`~~                                   | ~~Modify `get_parameter`, `get_attribute` to return the full `Value` object, not just the raw Python value. Adjust engine accordingly.~~ | **COMPLETED:** Runtime getters now return Value objects as of 2025-01-21. |
| **Medium**   | **Implement Function Registry & Execution**             | `engine.py`                                    | Create a function registry mechanism. Implement missing built-in functions (`tijdsduur van`, `som van`, etc.) using the registry in `_handle_function_call`. | **Functionality/Extensibility:** Provides a structured way to add and call functions. |
| **Medium**   | **Add Type Checking to CLI Data Loading**               | `cli.py` (`run` command)                       | Implement the "TODO" for type checking loaded parameters and attributes against the definitions in the `DomainModel`. Convert values if necessary/possible. | **Robustness:** Prevents invalid data from corrupting the runtime state early on. |
| **Medium**   | **Refactor REPL Evaluate Command**                    | `repl.py` (`handle_evaluate`)                  | Replace basic string splitting with a call to parse the input expression using `RegelSpraakParser` (targeting the `expressie` rule) and then evaluate it using the `Evaluator`. | **Functionality/Correctness:** Allows evaluating arbitrary valid RegelSpraak expressions in the REPL. |
| **Low**      | **Enhance Tracing Consistency**                       | `engine.py`, `runtime.py`                        | Review evaluation methods (`evaluate_expression`, handlers) and context setters to add more granular `TraceSink` calls where appropriate (e.g., `value_read`, `function_call`). | **Debugging/Observability:** Provides more detailed insight into execution flow. |
| **Low**      | **Improve ANTLR Jar Path Handling**                   | `Makefile`                                     | Parameterize the ANTLR jar path or use a standard dependency management approach if possible within the project constraints. | **Build Flexibility:** Makes the build less dependent on a specific hardcoded path. |
| **Low**      | **Review `Operator` Enum Semantics**                  | `ast.py`                                       | Re-evaluate if `IS` and `IN` truly belong in the `Operator` enum alongside arithmetic/logical ops, or if they need distinct representation in the AST reflecting their specific semantics. | **Clarity/Design:** Ensures the AST accurately reflects the different kinds of operations. |

This plan provides a roadmap for significantly improving the codebase's quality, robustness, and maintainability. Addressing the Critical and High priority items is essential for creating a reliable RegelSpraak engine.

## Recent Fixes and Improvements (2025-06-20)

### Expression System Overhaul
- **Fixed "list has no attribute span" error**: visitExpressie now properly delegates to visitLogicalExpression instead of using generic visit()
- **Implemented logical operators**: EN/OF operators with correct precedence via logicalExpression rule
- **Fixed parameter resolution**: "de volwassenleeftijd" no longer concatenated to "devolwassenleeftijd" - uses proper path building
- **Added new operators**: IS_NIET, HEEFT, HEEFT_NIET for kenmerk and possession checks
- **Grammar improvements**: Reordered comparisonExpression alternatives to resolve parse ambiguities
- **Unary operator support**: Both MIN keyword and MINUS (-) symbol now supported
- **Numeric literals with units**: Support for expressions like "100 km"
- **Collection support**: Added Lijst datatype and IN operator

### Test Suite Status
- All 290 tests now pass (8 skipped) - increased from 285 with FeitCreatie tests
- Fixed 14 expression-related test failures  
- Tracing tests fully functional with RULE_FIRED events properly generated
- CLI and engine tests passing

- Feittype tests added (2025-06-22)
- Operator semantics tests added (2025-06-25)
- ObjectCreatie tests added (2025-06-25)
- FeitCreatie tests added (2025-12-27)

### Unit System Implementation (2025-01-21) - FULLY INTEGRATED
- **Unit Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive unit system in `units.py`
  - BaseUnit and CompositeUnit classes for simple and compound units
  - UnitSystem for grouping related units (length, time, currency, etc.)
  - UnitRegistry for managing all unit systems
  - Support for unit conversions within the same system
- **Unit-Aware Arithmetic**: Added `arithmetic.py` with operations that preserve units
  - Addition/subtraction with unit compatibility checking
  - Multiplication/division creates composite units (e.g., km/h * h = km)
  - Special GEDEELD_DOOR_ABS operator with 5 decimal places
  - Decimal place preservation per RegelSpraak v2.1.0 specification
- **Engine Integration** (commit c5d7b25):
  - `_handle_binary` uses UnitArithmetic for all arithmetic operations
  - `_handle_unary` uses UnitArithmetic.negate() for unary minus
  - All expression evaluation returns Value objects with preserved units
  - Function calls (min/max) handle unit conversions properly
- **Runtime Changes**: 
  - Value class now uses 'unit' instead of 'eenheid'
  - get_parameter() and get_attribute() return Value objects
  - All tests updated to work with new structure

### Architecture Improvements
- Refactored parsing.py into a simple frontend (4KB)
- Moved all complex logic to builder.py (67KB) for better separation of concerns
- Parameter vs attribute reference disambiguation now uses existing infrastructure

### Semantic Analysis Implementation (2025-01-22) - UPDATED ANALYSIS (2025-01-23)
- **New Module**: Added `semantics.py` (~350 lines) with complete semantic analysis
  - SymbolTable class with scoped symbol resolution (global and rule scopes)
  - Symbol tracking for parameters, variables, object types, and rules
  - Two-pass analysis: Pass 1 collects definitions, Pass 2 validates references
  - Special handling for KenmerkToekenning "Een ObjectType" pattern
- **CLI Integration**: Both `validate` and `run` commands now perform semantic checks
  - Catches undefined references before runtime
  - Provides precise error locations with SourceSpan
  - Prevents execution when semantic errors exist
- **Architecture Fix**: Addresses the critical gap of missing semantic validation
  - Foundation for future type checking and cross-rule validation
  - Note: Builder still uses `parameter_names` tracking - investigation revealed this is necessary for current architecture
- **Parameter Tracking Analysis (2025-01-23)**: 
  - Investigation of removing `parameter_names` hack revealed semantic analyzer expects distinct AST node types
  - Semantic analyzer treats "parameter referenced as attribute" as an error (line 323-329 in semantics.py)
  - Removal would cause spurious errors for all valid parameter references
  - Proper fix would require either grammar changes or architectural redesign
  - Decision: Keep hack until broader architectural changes are warranted

### Operator Handling Refactoring (2025-06-22)
- **Issue**: Redundant operator mapping with both OPERATOR_MAP and OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP
- **Root cause**: All operators are lexer tokens, no need for text-based mapping
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed OPERATOR_TEXT_MAP dictionary (34 lines)
  - Simplified _build_binary_expression to handle only terminal nodes
  - Added logic to extract terminal operator from context wrapper when needed
- **Result**: Cleaner code with single source of truth for operator mappings

### Attribute Path Construction Fix (2025-06-22)
- **Issue**: Grammar allowed nested structures in attribute names, causing ambiguous parsing
- **Root cause**: attribuutReferentie used complex naamwoord rule instead of simple attribute name
- **Solution**: 
  - Added attribuutMetLidwoord rule for simple attribute names per spec 13.4.1.9
  - Fixed visitOnderwerpReferentieToPath to process all basisOnderwerp elements
  - Implemented nested object traversal in engine (requires ObjectReference datatype)
- **Result**: Paths like "de naam van de burgemeester van de hoofdstad" now correctly parse to ["naam", "burgemeester", "hoofdstad"]
- **Note**: Full nested object support awaits Feittype implementation

### Domain Support Implementation (2025-06-22)
- **Issue**: Domains (custom types) were not properly implemented
- **Root cause**: Grammar required incorrect "DOMEIN" keyword in references
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed domeinRef grammar rule to remove DOMEIN keyword requirement
  - Added visitDomeinRef method in builder.py
  - Fixed visitDomeinDefinition to handle units via eenheidExpressie
  - Added DOMAIN to SymbolKind enum in semantics.py
  - Added domain collection to semantic analysis Pass 1
- **Result**: Domains like "Bedrag" and "Luchthavens" can be defined and used as datatypes
- **Note**: Per specification, domain names must be single identifiers (no spaces)

### Feittype Implementation (2025-06-22)
- **Issue**: Feittype (relationship types) were not implemented, blocking object relationships
- **Root cause**: Missing AST nodes, builder methods, and runtime support for object references
- **Solution**:
  - Added FeitType and Rol classes to ast.py (frozen dataclasses)
  - Added feittypen dictionary to DomainModel
  - Implemented visitFeitTypeDefinition in builder.py
    - Correctly handles ctx.object_ (with underscore due to Python reserved word)
    - Extracts full feittype names including prepositions (e.g., "partner van Persoon")
    - Note: Role name extraction limited by grammar - all roles get "unknown_role"
  - Added FEITTYPE to SymbolKind enum in semantics.py
  - Added feittype collection to semantic analysis Pass 1
  - Enhanced semantic analysis to mark attributes as object references when datatype matches an object type
  - Updated runtime.py to handle ObjectReference datatype in set_attribute
  - Created comprehensive test suite in test_feittype_complete.py
- **Result**: 
  - Feittype definitions parse correctly (both regular and wederkerig/reciprocal)
  - Attributes with object type as datatype are marked as is_object_ref
  - Runtime correctly stores and retrieves object references
  - Foundation laid for ObjectCreatieActie and complex object relationships
- **Limitations**:
  - Role names cannot be extracted due to grammar structure (all show as "unknown_role")
  - Object-type attributes not yet supported in grammar (test skipped)
  - Full nested object traversal awaits complete object reference implementation

### ObjectCreatie Implementation (2025-06-25)
- **Issue**: ObjectCreatie (object creation rules) were not implemented despite grammar support
- **Root cause**: Visitor method was commented out, no AST node, no engine support
- **Solution**:
  - Changed grammar label from ObjectCreatieActie to ObjectCreatieResultaat for consistency
  - Added ObjectCreatie AST node extending ResultaatDeel
  - Implemented visitObjectCreatieResultaatContext in builder.py
    - Parses "Er wordt een nieuw X aangemaakt" syntax
    - Handles optional attribute initialization with "met" clauses
    - Fixed string literal parsing to strip both single and double quotes
  - Added special handling in engine.py execute_model
    - ObjectCreatie rules execute once per rule, not per instance
    - Prevents infinite loops when creating objects
  - Implemented _apply_object_creation in engine.py
    - Creates RuntimeObject with UUID-based instance_id
    - Initializes attributes from expressions
    - Adds object_created trace event
  - Enhanced semantic analysis to validate ObjectCreatie
    - Checks object type exists
    - Validates attribute names against object type definition
  - Created comprehensive test suite in test_object_creation_integration.py
- **Result**:
  - Object creation rules now fully functional
  - Can create objects with or without initial attribute values
  - Errors are captured in execution results rather than thrown
  - Test count increased from 276 to 282 (8 skipped)
- **Design decisions**:
  - ObjectCreatie rules execute once globally, not per existing instance
  - Errors don't halt execution but are reported in results
  - Instance IDs use UUID to ensure uniqueness

### FeitCreatie Implementation (2025-12-27)
- **Issue**: FeitCreatie (relationship creation rules) were not implemented despite grammar support
- **Root cause**: Missing AST node, builder visitor, and engine support for creating relationships via navigation
- **Solution**:
  - Added FeitCreatie AST node extending ResultaatDeel
  - Implemented visitFeitCreatieResultaatContext in builder.py
    - Extracts full feittype names including prepositions (e.g., "passagier met recht op treinmiles")
    - Parses subject patterns with articles (e.g., "een passagier van de reis")
    - Handles multi-hop navigation patterns
  - Fixed grammar to prioritize naamwoord pattern for rule names
  - Fixed kenmerk expressions to use Literal instead of VariableReference
  - Implemented _apply_feitcreatie in engine.py
    - Navigates complex relationship patterns by splitting on "van"
    - Handles multi-hop traversal through relationship graph
    - Checks object types match feittype roles
    - Creates relationships with proper trace events
  - Enhanced _deduce_rule_target_type to handle multi-word object types
    - Prioritizes last word matching (most specific)
    - Tries longer word combinations as fallback
  - Created comprehensive test suite in test_feitcreatie_integration.py
- **Result**:
  - All 5 FeitCreatie tests pass (test count increased from 285 to 290)
  - Complex navigation patterns work (e.g., "medewerker van afdeling van bonusgever")
  - Reciprocal relationships supported
  - Conditional FeitCreatie execution works
  - Can create relationships for multiple matching objects
- **Design decisions**:
  - Navigation patterns split on "van" for relationship traversal
  - Articles preserved in subject text for object identity
  - Relationships created for all objects matching navigation criteria
  - Error handling allows partial success (some relationships may fail)

### Verdeling Multi-Line Syntax Fix (2025-07-05)
- **Issue**: Verdeling rules with multiple criteria or remainder clauses couldn't parse the multi-line format specified in RegelSpraak v2.1.0
- **Root cause**: Grammar expected comma-separated methods, but specification requires newlines with bullet points when using colon format
- **Solution**:
  - Updated lexer to include "een" in BIJ_EVEN_GROOT_CRITERIUM token per specification
  - Modified grammar to support both single-line (simple) and multi-line (with colon) formats
  - Added verdelingMethodeMultiLine rule for colon-based syntax with bullet points
  - Updated builder.py to handle both formats in visitVerdelingResultaat
- **Result**:
  - All 6 Verdeling tests pass (test count increased from 328 to 334)
  - Single-line format works for simple distributions
  - Multi-line format with colon works for complex distributions with:
    - Multiple distribution methods (ordering, proportional, etc.)
    - Maximum constraints
    - Rounding specifications
    - Remainder handling with "Als onverdeelde rest blijft"
- **Design decisions**:
  - Simple distributions use single-line format without colon
  - Complex distributions require multi-line format with colon and bullet points
  - Grammar follows formal EBNF specification section 13.4.10 exactly

### Dimensions (Dimensies) Implementation (2025-07-15)
- **Issue**: Multi-valued attributes indexed by dimension labels were not implemented, identified as highest priority missing feature
- **Root cause**: No AST nodes, builder support, or engine handling for dimensioned attributes
- **Solution**:
  - Added Dimension, DimensionLabel, and DimensionedAttributeReference AST nodes
  - Implemented visitDimensieDefinition in builder.py
    - Supports both prepositional ("van") and adjectival dimension styles
    - Handles multi-word dimension labels via naamwoord rule
  - Enhanced visitAttribuutReferentie with sophisticated pattern detection
    - Detects adjectival dimensions: "bruto inkomen" → dimension="bruto"
    - Detects prepositional dimensions: "inkomen van huidig jaar" → dimension="huidig jaar"
    - Handles both combined: "bruto inkomen van huidig jaar"
  - Added DimensionCoordinate to runtime for dimension value storage
  - Enhanced engine.py evaluate_expression for DimensionedAttributeReference
  - Updated _apply_resultaat to handle dimensioned targets in Gelijkstelling/Initialisatie
  - Added dimension validation to semantic analysis
- **Result**:
  - Dimension definition parsing works correctly
  - Runtime supports multi-dimensional value storage and retrieval
  - Engine correctly evaluates and sets dimensioned attributes
  - 3/4 specification tests pass (DateCalcExpr grammar conflict affects complex expressions)
- **Limitations**:
  - DateCalcExpr grammar rule too broad, captures dimension expressions incorrectly
  - Dimension name resolution uses heuristics, could be enhanced
- **Design decisions**:
  - DimensionLabel stores label text, dimension name resolved at runtime
  - Sophisticated pattern detection handles grammar consuming dimension info in naamwoord
  - Both dimension styles fully supported per specification


Okay, considering the vision of AI-Powered Explainability built upon the refactored codebase, here are the logical next steps:

**Foundation (Requires Completion of Prior Remediation Plan Items):**

Before effective AI explainability can be layered on top, several foundational elements from the initial remediation plan *must* be addressed. These are prerequisites:

1.  **Robust AST & Semantic Model (High Priority):** The AI needs a clean, unambiguous representation of the code's meaning. This requires:
    *   Completing the Semantic Analysis Phase (Symbol Table, Type Checking).
    *   Resolving Parameter/Variable References correctly.
    *   Refactoring Operator/Expression handling for clarity.
2.  **Accurate Runtime Engine (Critical Priority):** Explanations must reflect the *actual* execution. This necessitates:
    *   ~~Implementing correct Type/Unit handling in the engine.~~ ✓ COMPLETED
    *   ~~Fixing rule targeting/scoping.~~ ✓ COMPLETED (works correctly for implemented types)
3.  **Comprehensive Execution Tracing (Medium Priority, but Elevates for Explainability):** The `TraceSink` mechanism is the *primary data source* for explainability. Its enhancement becomes a critical enabler.

**Next Steps Towards AI-Powered Explainability:**

Assuming the foundational refactoring is underway or complete, the following steps specifically target AI explainability:

1.  **Step 1: Enhance Granularity and Structure of Execution Tracing (High Priority for Explainability)**
    *   **Location:** `engine.py`, `runtime.py`, `ast.py` (for spans)
    *   **Action:** Significantly enhance `TraceSink` and the events recorded by `Evaluator` and `RuntimeContext`.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Trace Events Needed:** Capture events for:
            *   Rule evaluation start/end (including which instance).
            *   Condition evaluation start/end (with outcome: true/false).
            *   Evaluation of *each part* of a complex condition/expression (recording intermediate values).
            *   Variable/Parameter/Attribute *reads* (what value was read?).
            *   Variable/Parameter/Attribute *writes* (old value, new value).
            *   Function calls (name, arguments, result).
            *   Rule firing (which rule, for which instance).
            *   Rule *not* firing (and why - e.g., condition false).
            *   Object creation/kenmerk assignment.
        *   **Event Structure:** Define a structured format (e.g., JSON) for `TraceEvent` details, including:
            *   `event_type` (e.g., `RULE_EVAL_START`, `CONDITION_EVAL`, `VAR_READ`, `ATTR_WRITE`).
            *   `timestamp` or logical step counter.
            *   `rule_name` (if applicable).
            *   `instance_id` (if applicable).
            *   `ast_node_span` (linking the event back to the source code via `SourceSpan`).
            *   `details`: A dictionary containing relevant data (variable names, values, operator, function name, etc.).
        *   **Implementation:** Modify `Evaluator.evaluate_expression`, `_handle_binary`, `_handle_unary`, `_handle_function_call`, `_apply_resultaat`, and `RuntimeContext` setters/getters to emit these detailed events via the `trace_sink`.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides the raw, fine-grained data trail necessary for an AI to reconstruct and explain the execution flow and calculations. Without this detailed log, explanations would be superficial guesswork.

2.  **Step 2: Integrate Semantic Information with Traces (Medium Priority)**
    *   **Location:** `engine.py` (Trace emission points), `TraceSink` implementations.
    *   **Action:** Ensure trace events can be linked back to the semantic model (the improved `DomainModel` and future `SymbolTable`).
    *   **Details:** When tracing variable/attribute/parameter events, include their defined types and units (obtained from the semantic model/symbol table) in the trace event details alongside their runtime values.
    *   **Rationale:** Allows the AI to explain not just *what* happened, but *why* in terms of the defined data types and rules (e.g., "leeftijd (Numeriek jr) was compared to volwassenleeftijd (Numeriek jr)").

3.  **Step 3: Develop an Explanation Query Interface (Medium Priority)**
    *   **Location:** New module (e.g., `explainability.py`), `cli.py`, `repl.py`.
    *   **Action:** Define how users will request explanations.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Identify common explanation needs: "Explain rule X", "Why is attribute Y of instance Z equal to V?", "Trace the calculation of variable A".
        *   Design simple commands or API calls to trigger these explanations (e.g., a new REPL command `:explain why person_15 is minderjarig`).
    *   **Rationale:** Creates the entry point for users to interact with the explainability features.

4.  **Step 4: Implement the Explanation Generation Module (Medium Priority)**
    *   **Location:** New module (e.g., `explainability.py`)
    *   **Action:** Create components that process trace data and generate explanations, likely using an LLM.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Trace Processor:** A function/class that takes the structured trace log and filters/selects relevant events based on the user's query (e.g., all events related to calculating `minderjarig` for `person_15`).
        *   **Context Retriever:** A function to fetch the relevant RegelSpraak source code snippets using the `SourceSpan` information stored in trace events and the AST. Also retrieves relevant semantic information (types, units).
        *   **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Design prompts that provide the LLM with:
            *   The user's question.
            *   The relevant filtered trace events (structured data).
            *   The relevant source code snippets.
            *   Relevant semantic context (definitions, types, units).
            *   Instructions on the desired explanation format (e.g., step-by-step, natural language summary).
        *   **LLM Interaction:** Code to interact with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local model) sending the constructed prompt and receiving the explanation.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the core AI integration point, translating the structured execution data and semantic context into human-understandable explanations via the LLM.

5.  **Step 5: Integrate and Refine (Low Priority - Iterative)**
    *   **Location:** `cli.py`, `repl.py`, `explainability.py`
    *   **Action:** Connect the query interface to the explanation generation module. Test and refine the prompts, trace data granularity, and explanation quality based on results.
    *   **Details:** Start with simpler explanations (e.g., explaining a single rule's text, tracing a direct calculation) and iteratively add more complex capabilities ("Why?" queries). Evaluate the accuracy and clarity of AI-generated explanations.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the features are usable and provide accurate, helpful insights. Explainability is often an iterative development process.

By following these steps, building upon the foundation laid by the initial refactoring, the codebase can be enhanced to provide powerful AI-driven explanations of how the RegelSpraak rules lead to specific outcomes. The key is capturing detailed, semantically-rich execution traces.

- **Attribute references**: Simple attribute name + "van" + complex subject chain (spec 13.4.1.9)

### Common Development Procedures

#### Adding Grammar Rules
1. Modify `grammar/RegelSpraak.g4` or `grammar/RegelSpraakLexer.g4`
2. Run `make parser` to regenerate
3. Update `builder.py` visitor methods
4. Add AST nodes to `ast.py` if needed
5. Write focused tests in `test_*.py`

#### Debugging Parser Issues
- "no viable alternative" → token conflicts
- Use ANTLR `-tokens` option for lexer debugging
- Add multi-word tokens for problematic phrases
- Check HIDDEN channel whitespace handling

#### Working with Runtime
- Create RuntimeContext with domain model
- Use RuntimeObject for instances
- Value objects for typed values with units
- TraceSink for execution monitoring
- execute_model() runs all rules

### Technical Constraints
- **No linting tools**: Manual style consistency required
- **ANTLR JAR**: Located at `lib/antlr-4.13.1-complete.jar`
- **Python 3.7+**: Minimum version requirement
- **Generated files**: `src/regelspraak/_antlr/` may not be in git
- **Test count**: 363 tests must pass (10 skipped acceptable)
